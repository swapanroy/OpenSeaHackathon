C is for Chlorophyll, N is for Nitrogen, O is for Oxygen, P is for Phosphate, and S is for Silicate.

# Timeseries data may be valuable for

## Ocean acidification

C and O time series data can be used to evaluate the progress and impacts of ocean acidification. C is a nutrient
required for the production of photosynthetic organisms, while O is an essential element for marine ecosystems. Ocean
acidification can limit the production and use of C and O. These changes may have an impact on the marine ecosystem as a
whole.

## Climate change

C, N, and O time series data can be used to evaluate the impact of climate change. C is a nutrient required for the
production of photosynthetic organisms, N is a constituent of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, and O is
an essential element for marine ecosystems. Changes in the supply and use of these nutrients may occur due to climate
change. In addition, climate change can alter marine ecosystem productivity and diversity.

## Harmful algal blooms

N, P, and S time series data can be used to evaluate the occurrence and impact of harmful algal blooms. N is a limiting
factor for biological productivity, while P and S are nutrients necessary for the production of phytoplankton. The
excessive supply of these nutrients can cause harmful algal blooms. Time series data can be analyzed to evaluate the
causes of harmful algal blooms and changes in their frequency.

## Marine pollution

C, N, O, P, and S time series data can be used to evaluate the impact of marine pollution. These nutrients and elements
are involved in the production and metabolism of pollutants. Changes in the supply and use of these nutrients and
elements may occur due to marine pollution. Time series data can be analyzed to evaluate the extent and long-term
changes of the impacts of marine pollution.

## Management of fishery resources

C, N, O, P, and S time series data can be used to assist in the management of fishery resources. These nutrients and
elements are involved in the production of fish and shellfish. Time series data can be analyzed to evaluate changes in
fishery resource productivity and condition, and to devise appropriate management strategies.

# Important problem in Baltic Ocean

The water quality in the Baltic Sea is more susceptible to ocean acidification than in the Mediterranean and Pacific,
especially in the southern waters, where pH values are lower. This may have an impact on organisms inhabiting the Baltic
Sea.

# Ocean acidification in the Baltic Sea

Much research has been conducted in recent years on ocean acidification in the Baltic Sea. In the Baltic Sea, ocean
acidification is mainly caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the ocean, which lowers the concentration
of calcium ions in the seawater and lowers the pH value. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the land water
flowing into the Baltic Sea is also thought to contribute to the progression of ocean acidification.

# Impacts on marine ecosystems in the Baltic Sea

Effect on reproductive cells and shells of mollusks and echinoderms
Ocean acidification reduces the concentration of calcium ions, which can affect the reproductive cells and shells of
mollusks and echinoderms. The shells of clams and echinoderms become brittle, which may result in a reduction of
reproductive success. This may cause a decrease in the number of mollusks and echinoderms in the Baltic Sea.

Effect on the production and types of plankton
Plankton is an important nutrient source in the marine ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. Ocean acidification can affect the
production and types of plankton, particularly the plankton with calcium carbonate shells. Reduced plankton production
and fewer types of plankton can impact food webs and the food sources of fish.

Effect on the behavior and growth of fish
Ocean acidification can impact sound and chemical information transmission in water, causing changes in the behavior of
fish. Additionally, it can also affect the growth and development of fish. Calcium ions are essential for the
development of fish eggs and larvae, and a low concentration of calcium ions may reduce their survival rate and growth.

# Impact to economy
The economic impacts of ocean acidification in the Baltic Sea include potential reductions in fishery yields and impacts on tourism. The decreased growth and strength of shellfish and other benthic organisms due to ocean acidification could potentially reduce fishery yields. Additionally, the degradation of the Baltic Sea's natural beauty and environment due to ocean acidification could impact tourism in the region. These impacts could have significant economic consequences for the fishery and tourism industries in the Baltic Sea region.
